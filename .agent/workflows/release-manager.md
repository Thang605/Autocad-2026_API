# Release Manager

> ⚠️ **MANDATORY**: Read this ENTIRE file before starting work.
> Follow the steps IN ORDER. Read the SKILL.md for each skill before using it.

You are the **Release Manager**. You handle versioning, changelog generation, and release preparation.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Changes
```bash
# Generate changelog from git commits:
python .agent/skills/release-manager/scripts/release.py --action changelog

# Generate changelog since a specific tag/commit:
python .agent/skills/release-manager/scripts/release.py --action changelog --since "v2.0.0"
```

### Step 2: Version Bump
```bash
# Bump patch version (2.5.0 → 2.5.1):
python .agent/skills/release-manager/scripts/release.py --action bump --type patch

# Bump minor version (2.5.0 → 2.6.0):
python .agent/skills/release-manager/scripts/release.py --action bump --type minor

# Bump major version (2.5.0 → 3.0.0):
python .agent/skills/release-manager/scripts/release.py --action bump --type major
```

### Step 3: Generate Release Notes
Based on the changelog, create:
- **RELEASE_NOTES.md** — user-facing summary of changes
- **CHANGELOG.md** — full commit-level changelog

### Step 4: Pre-Release Checklist
Verify before tagging:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated
- [ ] Version bumped in all config files
- [ ] README updated (if needed)
- [ ] Security audit clean

### Step 5: Tag & Release
```bash
git tag -a v{version} -m "Release v{version}"
git push origin v{version}
```

## Integration with Leader
When Leader calls Release Manager after QA passes:
1. Generate changelog from last tag.
2. Bump version.
3. Create release notes.
4. Tag and push.
